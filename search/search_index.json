Theres a lot of untold history that it's well known about the internet that is being retold today with the expansive online libraries. I personally had no idea their were ideas as powerful as having a memex, but this class has shown me to treat technology as an experiment. Learning new processes for improving my effeciency is a new idea to explore. I hope to expand my private library and hopefully contribute to the obsidian community.</p> <p>I've never seen the internet from the lenses of different ages of history, but it has certainly helped me understand the different parts that make up the web, and where I fit into that spectrum. Their are so many challenges that were overcome, but I feel much more comfortable knowing how to uncover the truth, and how to ask the questions that haven't been asked.</p> <p>The history of the internet is a fascinating tale of innovation and technological advancement that has transformed the way we communicate, work, and access information.

I hadn't thought about the different narratives in between, to no fault of my own as I was never told about them. I believe in this course I was unable to accomplish my goal, because I've been left with an impression about the many different narratives that had taken place (and some still are currently taking place), and the innovations behind many of tools that had to be created in order to give humans the tools to put the internet together.</p> <p>The journey starts with my atomic note on perspectivism </p> <p>Perspectivism is a theme from my annotations on  The tools we use have a history, they are artifacts of the history that created them, the political moment that created them, just as we are the history of those moments. </p> <p>This quote resonates, it helps convey how important each connection that was made throughout history helped impact the shape of the internet we have today. This was one of the major learning moments in this class, because I hadn't thought about why we needed the internet. There is a trail of information behind us that tells the tail of each development that was made throughout history, but I found an interesting idea in my annotations for @macdougallrobertTheKillerApp2014 </p> <p></p> <p>In my note about We left the cold war behind but not the computer, I was thinking 50 years into the future. Social media has such an incredible influence on the way our world has been shaped, and I really liked using Telephone Game as a metaphore of this. I remembed Dr. Graham sharing this idea with us in the beginning of the semester. As primitive of an idea that may seem as, I had a moment while making this annotation that connected how computers were created as an idea to warn the United States of a nuclear invasion, with how this idea turned into what we call social media today. They're completely different ideas with many stark differences in how they communicate information, but nonetheless I feel like this journey is a great example of how my thinking has evolved over the semester.</p> <p>I hadn't ever thought about the context of computers in this time period, but after making this connection I was sure that there were many new narratives that I had to peice together in order to understand the true history of the Internet. Despite this, one of the main things I tihink I lacked was a steady process for taking my annotations. It wasn't until later in the course did I have the time to build Obsidian into the programmable note taking solution that I want it to be, but it's through this struggle that I've had that I've began to ask new questions about how I interact with technology and ask questions about the tools that I'm using.</p> <p>By shifting my perspective, I've been able to pivot my interests and has shown me how powerful the medium you use to record your informaiton is. As an Engineer, I look forward to the summer where I can enjoy some free time to build a more structured memex. I felt as though I was lacking the right rituals to effeciently use the Memex. I struggled to use templates and wanted to write more maps of content, but I am glad to worked through these problems now, because I've realized how wrong I've been taking my courses in University. Their are many successful people throughout history who have invented incredible things with primitive tools, and it's through this lense that you can begin to appreciate the tools that we've been given with our personal devices. We don't need to treat technology as a distraction, we can use it as a tool to help connect us to bigger, brighter ideas. I can't imagine how much easier studying will become when a computer automates all of the storing and visualizing information, and hopefully by combining the many different ideas that I continue to study, I can find a way to make a meaningful contribution to this history.</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/0_Final%20Journey_1/","title":"0 Final Journey 1","text":"<p>what is the most powerful thing you've learned in this course?</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/0_Final%20Journey_1/#the-journey-between-trade-routes-that-shaped-the-world-and-alohanet","title":"The Journey between Trade routes that shaped the world and Alohanet","text":"<p>Trade routes that shaped world history The Silk Road annotations for @caulfieldmikeTheGardenandtheStream2015 @caulfieldmikeTheGardenandtheStream2015 annotations for @bushvannevarAsWeMayThink1945 @bushvannevarAsWeMayThink1945 Precontext of Technology Codes and Combinations Morse Code Invention of the Telegraph Prehistory of the Internet The first internet Alohanet</p> <p>Before this class, I had an idea about what I knew about the internet, but what I've never considered are the incredible ways that humans have stored and consumed information throughout history. On this final journey through my memex, I take you through the story of how important trading networks became in the creation of the internet. The most powerful thing you can learn from the history of networks are the different stages that information can be traded at, and how combining information has lead to the most innovative advances in human history. Strong networks were the backbone of human innovation, and it's incredible to see what was accomplished by combining primitive concepts together to form new complex ideas.</p> <p></p> <p>Alas, Throughout human history we have seen the interesting new ways that information is transmitted and stored. The journey of the internet began with the concept of trading information. This idea spawned the idea of searching for Trade routes that shaped world history. When we think of the internet, we think of some kind of website, however the concept of the Internet is not new. Looking back thousands of years ago, one of the first milestones of human trading information was in the inseption of The Silk Road In the map above, we can see how impressive the Silk Road was at connecting the world together on land and sea. Through it's creation, new technologies could be assembled as new ideas could be transported around the globe, and thus we get a glimpse at what the world once was. Some incredible findings such as paper was invented, to put humans in that time period in the age of informaiton. It's incedible to imagine what discoveries were made and documented during these times, such as gunpowder and the compass! </p> <p>The idea to search for trade routes were from my annotations for @caulfieldmikeTheGardenandtheStream2015  where I looked back on how interconnected things have to be in order to really find new inovations. This idea that the Silk Road inter relates to the internet really sparked a new perspective on what information sharing looked like throughout history, and I believe that the lense of viewing the internet through the exchange of 'paper' really helps you appreciate the art of the internet.</p> <p>It was while reading @caulfieldmikeTheGardenandtheStream2015, where I wanted to learn;  Making this incredible connection between the Silk Road and the capabilities of Vannevar Bush and the United states helps lead us to the idea of how Dr. Bush was able to build some of the greatest inventions of all of human history, without the use of the Internet. I was able to read more about him and found some interesting facts in my  annotations for @bushvannevarAsWeMayThink1945 where Dr. Bush had really conceived the idea of a real use case for having a personal computer device and new ideas for using technology to assist in research. I believe it is powerful to realize the true scale of the internet when you read a paper during that period in history, and nonetheless reading @bushvannevarAsWeMayThink1945 has helped convey the importance of assemblage theory and how giving humans access to these vaults of information can help lead to the invention of different ideas. </p> <p>We have reached the crux of Precontext of Technology, and it was around this time period that we began to see a shift towards the peices that built the internet we use today. It was with the precontext of Technology that we saw how combinations and code took off the development of the ways we transmit data. We can see in my connection that it was with Morse Code </p> <p>it's with the invention of Morse Code that helped humans transmit data over distance with the Invention of the Telegraph. It's with combination of these technologies that bring us to the brink of having all the peices to give us the internet. Most people forget about how incredible the development of the telegraph was for it's time, and what's even more satisfying is seeing the different ways that the telegraph helped invent the internet. </p> <p>It's in the research that went into developing new ways to transmit ideas that we land at the beginning of what we call the modern internet today.  Prehistory of the Internet is nothing short of an experiment, and it's on this topic that I decided to explore some ideas of the actual first internet was/</p> <p>The first internet looked like like many things, but I found the most powerful experiment done on the internet was the innovation behind Alohanet .</p> <p> </p> <p>It's surprising to imagine how important Hawaii was in the creation of the internet, and how imprtant experimental network development is. The Alohanet was a small innovation on the timeline of the internet, but was another example of a network that changed the way information was traded. Using radio signals and turning the internet from something that you physically connected to, to a wireless, abstract thing that transmits in the air is an incredible step in the timeline of the internet, and has taught me how important experimenting with new ideas can lead to the arrival of new applications in science. </p> <p>It was in this class that I learned how experimental the Internet still is. Many of the features we see today can be attributed to the sharing of information and finding the most effecient way to do it. From the Silk Road, to Alohanet, the internet is a demonstration of human's search for innovating ways of connecting people, and how innovative we've become through sharing our ideas. This journey is an example of how different ways of sharing information has lead to the innovation of new things, a powerful concept to think about as the internet continues to evolve and grow. Ideas can't grow unless they can be shared, and humans have always found new ways to improve the way they communicate with each other.</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/1940s%20Assemblage%20Theory/","title":"1940s Assemblage Theory","text":"<p>Competences - existence of digital computers - existence of telecommunication networks - existence of information theory - ideas around flow control, logic, algorithms - demonstration of control of a calculator over a phone line in 1940</p> <p>Where are the computers?</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/2023-04-11/","title":"2023 04 11","text":"<p>Gotta link me notes with the themes</p> <p>Take speaker notes and combine with tags</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/%40IntroductionMediaasHistoricalStudies/","title":"source #todo","text":""},{"location":"Public%20Notes/%40borypaoloFromTheInternetImaginaryToNetworkIdeologies2020/","title":"@borypaoloFromTheInternetImaginaryToNetworkIdeologies2020","text":"<p>Title: @borypaoloFromTheInternetImaginaryToNetworkIdeologies2020 type: reference</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/%40borypaoloFromTheInternetImaginaryToNetworkIdeologies2020/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Bory, Paolo. 2020 Chapter 1 &amp; 2 in\u00a0The Internet myth: From the Internet Imaginary to Network Ideologies https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv12fw7sn.7</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/%40borypaoloFromTheInternetImaginaryToNetworkIdeologies2020/#summary-key-take-aways","title":"Summary &amp; Key Take Aways","text":"<p>Ch1 - Internet Histories, Narratives and the Rise of the Network Ideology</p> <p>In the book the Internet Myth, the first chapter develops the bigger picture of how the internet formed and the multiplicity of Internet histories and makes visible the complex path of different network projects that have taken place over a variety of cultural, political, economic and social contexts.

It was driven by hobbyists, entrepreneurs, and activists who used personal computers connected via dial-up modems to create early online communities. This created an alternative to ARPANET which was created by professional researchers in university and government labs. The predominant form of PC networking was the bulletin board system (BBS), hosted on off-the-shelf microcomputers running homebuilt software. To bring users from different regions together, FidoNet was developed - an international network of BBSs that allowed users to send messages to each other across long distances without incurring long-distance charges. This enabled users to access discussion forums, software archives, and \u201cCB simulator\u201d chat channels on different systems. The modem world was also home to some of the first experiments in digital activism and online civil society where people learned to negotiate boundaries between public and private space as well as creating virtual communities with their own norms and conventions.

It used vacuum tubes to perform calculations and was used for a variety of military applications.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, computer technology continued to develop rapidly. The invention of the transistor in 1947 made it possible to build smaller, faster, and more reliable computers. IBM's System/360, introduced in 1964, was a family of compatible mainframe computers that revolutionized the computer industry.</p> <p>In the 1970s, the development of microprocessors made it possible to build smaller and cheaper computers, leading to the development of personal computers. The Apple II, introduced in 1977, was one of the first successful personal computers.</p> <p>The 1980s and 1990s saw the development of more powerful and versatile computers, including the introduction of graphical user interfaces and the internet. The 2000s saw the development of mobile devices and the rise of cloud computing.</p> <p>Today, computers are ubiquitous and play a vital role in almost every aspect of modern life, from communication and entertainment to business and scientific research.

At the time, communication networks were typically circuit-switched, meaning that a dedicated physical connection was established between two devices for the duration of the communication.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began to experiment with a new approach to network communication called packet switching. Instead of using dedicated circuits, packet switching broke up messages into small packets of data and sent them independently over the network. Each packet contained information about its destination and routing information, allowing it to be transmitted through the network along multiple paths to reach its destination.</p> <p>The first packet-switched network was developed by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the UK in the late 1960s. Known as the NPL network, it was a local area network that used packet switching to allow researchers to share computing resources.</p> <p>In the 1970s, the idea of packet switching was further developed by researchers at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the United States. They developed the ARPANET, a packet-switched network that connected research institutions across the country. The ARPANET became the foundation for the internet, which today uses packet switching to transmit data across the globe.</p> <p>Packet switching has several advantages over circuit switching. It allows multiple devices to share the same communication channel, increasing the efficiency of network usage. It also allows for more reliable communication, as packets can be retransmitted if they are lost or damaged during transmission.</p> <p>Overall, packet switching has revolutionized network communication and has enabled the development of the modern internet and the many applications and services that rely on it.</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/Part%201%20-%20Precontext%20to%20Technology/","title":"Part 1   Precontext to Technology","text":"<p>In this sectionwhich explores several influential works related to information technology and knowledge management.

Here are a few examples of how assemblage theory can help us understand the development of the internet:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The development of the World Wide Web: The World Wide Web is a classic example of an assemblage. It was created by combining various technologies and software, including the hypertext markup language (HTML), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), and web browsers. These different elements were combined in new ways to create a revolutionary new technology that transformed the way we communicate and share information.</p> </li> <li> <p>The development of social media: Social media is another example of an assemblage. It is made up of various elements, including social networking platforms, mobile devices, and user-generated content. Social media platforms are constantly evolving as new technologies and user behaviors emerge, and these changes are driven by the interactions between the different elements in the assemblage.</p> </li> <li> <p>The development of online marketplaces: Online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay are also examples of assemblages. They are made up of various elements, including online payment systems, logistics networks, and user-generated product reviews. These different elements come together to create a new kind of market that is radically different from traditional brick-and-mortar stores.</p> </li> <li> <p>The development of search engines: Search engines like Google are another example of an assemblage. They are made up of various technologies and algorithms that work together to deliver relevant search results to users. These different elements are constantly changing and adapting to new user behaviors, resulting in a complex and dynamic system that is constantly evolving.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, assemblage theory provides a useful framework for understanding the complex and dynamic nature of the internet and the various technologies and systems that make it possible.</p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/Space%20Economy%20Theory/","title":"Space Economy Theory","text":"<p>Title: PUT THE TITLE OF NOTE HERE date: {{date}} type: literature project:</p> <p>tags::  projects::</p> <ul> <li>One idea per note - but as complete as possible in your own words</li> <li>Write as if you are writing for someone else.

One of the most famous codes of this time was the Caesar Cipher, which was named after Julius Caesar and involved shifting each letter of the alphabet by a certain number of positions.</p> <p>During the Renaissance, the use of secret codes became more sophisticated, with the development of polyalphabetic ciphers, where multiple alphabets are used in a single message, making it harder to decipher.</p> <p>In the 20th century, the use of secret codes became increasingly important in military and intelligence operations, particularly during World War II. The Enigma machine, a cipher machine used by the Germans, was famously cracked by Allied cryptanalysts, including Alan Turing, which helped shorten the war.</p> <p>Today, secret codes and encryption methods are widely used to protect sensitive information, particularly in online communications. Advanced encryption methods such as public key cryptography have made it possible to create unbreakable codes that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient.</p> <p>How many ways can you manipulate language as a means to invent new ways of communicating Language is redundant </p> <p>Morse Code Braille Binary bytes and hex ASCII Fixed Point, Floating Point </p> <p>Computer Code </p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/controversa%20de%20nobilitate/","title":"Controversa de nobilitate","text":"<p>The \"Controversia de nobilitate\" was a 14th-century philosophical debate on whether noble birth or personal merit was more important in determining a person's worth and status in society. source: @makbonnieHowThePageMatters2011 </p>"},{"location":"Public%20Notes/modem/","title":"Modem","text":"<p>modulates digital pulses into sounds, demoulates sounds into digital data. invented in 1949 for transmitting radar signals.
