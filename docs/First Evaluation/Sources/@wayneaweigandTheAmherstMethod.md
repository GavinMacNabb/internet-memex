### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this debate, Wayne A. Weigand discusses the context of library classification and how the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme remains so elusive. He brings up two points, tat Melvil Dewey schemed the classification having bearded in mind that more information would have more stored than previous historians thoughts, and expending the understanding of his decisions in the classification structure. He discusses the significance the classification system had on accessing information around the world and how it permitted a person to find knowledge from any library.
