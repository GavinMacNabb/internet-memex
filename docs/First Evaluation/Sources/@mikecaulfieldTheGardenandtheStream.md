### Summary & Key Take Aways

This speech argued that the internet is mainly a social web for learning and research, but as a species we need to get past this old model and move forward. The speaker introduced two terms representing different approaches to how we see the web, The Garden and the Stream. The Garden is an arrangement of relationships between things and the Stream is a single, time ordered path with our experience in the middle of it. It discussed tools to help build gardens of knowledge and raised the question why people spend so much time arguing over if they’re right than contributing to the poll of knowledge. It concludes that there may be a sign of a shift towards these technologies, but we can imagine a world so much better if we contribute to these garden communities.
