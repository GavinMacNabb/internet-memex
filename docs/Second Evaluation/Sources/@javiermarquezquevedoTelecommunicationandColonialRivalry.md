### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the Article “Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry: European Telegraph Cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa, 1883-1914”, Jaview Marquez Quevedo analyzes the competition between European powers over control of submarine telegraph cables in the Atlantic and Africa at the end of the nineteenth century, and how telecommunication systems influenced geopolitical situations of the Canary Islands and their African hinterland. Germany put pressure on Spain to consent to the cable in the Canaries, which threatened French and British interests. Great Britain advocated for an Anglo-Spanish collaboration to guarantee security in Gibraltar and to keep Germany away from the Spanish islands. Germany was also interested in obtaining coaling stations and telegraph landing points in Dutch or Spanish territories. The possibility of lying a cable to Morocco was a concern for the British and French. Despite the competition, France, Germany, and Britain eventually agreed to merge their projects in the South Atlantic towards Brazil, Togo, and Cameroon, benefiting both sides commercially.
