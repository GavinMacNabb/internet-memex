### Summary & Key Take Aways

Faxed is a book by Jonathan Coopersmith that discusses the history of the facsimile machine, or fax, from its invention in 1843 to its decline in the 21st century. Coopersmith explores how the fax contributed to the acceleration of communications, information flow, and the vibrant visual culture of our contemporary world. The book reveals what inspired the fax machines, how the demand for the fax machine eventually caught up to it’s availability, and why shifts in technology eventually rendered the fax obsolete.
