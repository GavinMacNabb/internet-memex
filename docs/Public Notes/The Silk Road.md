The Silk Road was established during the Han Dynasty in China (206 BCE â€“ 220 CE) and continued to be used until the 14th century. The Silk Road had a significant impact on the economy, culture, and political systems of the countries and regions that were connected by it. The Silk Road also contributed to the development of new technologies and innovations such as paper-making, gunpowder, and the compass.

The Silk Road was a network of trade routes that connected China with the Mediterranean world, including Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The Silk Road was not a single road but a collection of trade routes that passed through various regions, including Central Asia, India, and Persia.
