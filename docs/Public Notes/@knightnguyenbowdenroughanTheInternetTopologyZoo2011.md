### Summary & Key Take Aways

This paper describes the Internet Topology datasets as a Zoo, based on manual transcriptions of public network maps containing over 232 networks and growing. The Zoo dataset aims to provide resources for those to validate measurements or test [[algorithms]] on real networks and help create opportunities for considering other networks for future work.
