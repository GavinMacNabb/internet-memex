### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the journal article by Peter J. Denning, he discusses the origins of the computer network known as the ARPANET, as well as retrospect the revolutionary changes that have emerged in our use of computers that began 20 years ago. The ARPANET began operations in 1969 with four nodes as an experiment of sharing information resources, and today it has evolved to a worldwide research network with over 60,000 nodes.
