Assemblage theory can be applied to many different fields, including the history of the internet. Here are a few examples of how assemblage theory can help us understand the development of the internet:

1.  The development of the World Wide Web: The World Wide Web is a classic example of an assemblage. It was created by combining various technologies and software, including the hypertext markup language (HTML), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), and web browsers. These different elements were combined in new ways to create a revolutionary new technology that transformed the way we communicate and share information.
    
2.  The development of social media: Social media is another example of an assemblage. It is made up of various elements, including social networking platforms, mobile devices, and user-generated content. Social media platforms are constantly evolving as new technologies and user behaviors emerge, and these changes are driven by the interactions between the different elements in the assemblage.
    
3.  The development of online marketplaces: Online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay are also examples of assemblages. They are made up of various elements, including online payment systems, logistics networks, and user-generated product reviews. These different elements come together to create a new kind of market that is radically different from traditional brick-and-mortar stores.
    
4.  The development of search engines: Search engines like Google are another example of an assemblage. They are made up of various technologies and algorithms that work together to deliver relevant search results to users. These different elements are constantly changing and adapting to new user behaviors, resulting in a complex and dynamic system that is constantly evolving.
    

Overall, assemblage theory provides a useful framework for understanding the complex and dynamic nature of the internet and the various technologies and systems that make it possible.
