A funny spin off of Language redundancy...

Saying _suh dude_ as a slurred, shortform way of saying “What’s up, dude?” appears to originate with Vine comedian Nick Colletti and his friend Tanner “Getter” Petulla (also a DJ). On March 23, 2015, Colletti uploaded a Vine video featuring Petulla saying _(a)_ _suh dude_ for _What’s up, dude?_  (often shortened to _sup_).
