>To matter is not only to be of importance, to signify, to mean, but also to claim a certain physical space, to have a particular space, to be uniquely embodied.

The medium of the message is just as important as the message itself. The space it takes up and how it takes up space has as much meaning.

>we are taught to believe the boundaries of the interface are always identical to the edges of the material platform of the page

This depicts why the page matters, if you provide someone a different way of doing something, a different outcome will occur.

Retrospectively, the edges of mathematics have what pushed the invention of the computer and digital computation devices.

---
>The page has played a central role in preserving the intellectual and artistic traditions of the West for over two millenia.

Without preserving information, we cannot continue to advance in our discoveries.

This idea that Vannevar Bush had in his article about how we need to improve the way we research is indicitive to maintaining the level of information that his network of scientists had access too. How does the creation of these new tools play out in the long run?

>Whether thick, thin, brittle, smooth, dog-eared or stained, every page discloses a unique identity that has been shaped by culture over time.

The unique identity of the page presents new ideas about the culture within a certain time period.

>Whether a product of manuscript, print, digital or hybrid technologies, the controversa de nobilitate constitutes a thick network of expression that continues to be augmented as it passes through history.
