Before this class, I had an idea about what I knew about the internet, but what I've never considered are the incredible ways that humans have stored and consumed information throughout history. On this final journey through my memex, I take you through the story of how important trading networks became in the creation of the internet. The most powerful thing you can learn from the history of networks are the different stages that information can be traded at, and how combining information has lead to the most innovative advances in human history. Strong networks were the backbone of human innovation, and it's incredible to see what was accomplished by combining primitive concepts together to form new complex ideas.

Alas, Throughout human history we have seen the interesting new ways that information is transmitted and stored. The journey of the internet began with the concept of trading information. This idea spawned the idea of searching for [[Trade routes that shaped world history]]. When we think of the internet, we think of some kind of website, however the concept of the Internet is not new. Looking back thousands of years ago, one of the first milestones of human trading information was in the inseption of [[The Silk Road]]![[The Silk Road]]
In the map above, we can see how impressive the Silk Road was at connecting the world together on land and sea. Through it's creation, new technologies could be assembled as new ideas could be transported around the globe, and thus we get a glimpse at what the world once was. Some incredible findings such as paper was invented, to put humans in that time period in the age of informaiton. It's incedible to imagine what discoveries were made and documented during these times, such as gunpowder and the compass! 

The idea to search for trade routes were from my [[annotations for @caulfieldmikeTheGardenandtheStream2015]]  where I looked back on how interconnected things have to be in order to really find new inovations. This idea that the Silk Road inter relates to the internet really sparked a new perspective on what information sharing looked like throughout history, and I believe that the lense of viewing the internet through the exchange of 'paper' really helps you appreciate the art of the internet.

It was while reading [[@caulfieldmikeTheGardenandtheStream2015]], where I wanted to learn; ![[Who is Vannevar Bush?]]
Making this incredible connection between the Silk Road and the capabilities of Vannevar Bush and the United states helps lead us to the idea of how Dr. Bush was able to build some of the greatest inventions of all of human history, without the use of the Internet. I was able to read more about him and found some interesting facts in my  [[annotations for @bushvannevarAsWeMayThink1945]] where Dr. Bush had really conceived the idea of a real use case for having a personal computer device and new ideas for using technology to assist in research. I believe it is powerful to realize the true scale of the internet when you read a paper during that period in history, and nonetheless reading [[@bushvannevarAsWeMayThink1945]] has helped convey the importance of assemblage theory and how giving humans access to these vaults of information can help lead to the invention of different ideas. 

We have reached the crux of [[Precontext of Technology]], and it was around this time period that we began to see a shift towards the peices that built the internet we use today. It was with the precontext of Technology that we saw how [[combinations and code]] took off the development of the ways we transmit data. We can see in my connection that it was with [[Morse Code]] 
![[Morse Code]]

it's with the invention of Morse Code that helped humans transmit data over distance with the [[Invention of the Telegraph]]. It's with combination of these technologies that bring us to the brink of having all the peices to give us the internet. Most people forget about how incredible the development of the telegraph was for it's time, and what's even more satisfying is seeing the different ways that the telegraph helped invent the internet. 

It's in the research that went into developing new ways to transmit ideas that we land at the beginning of what we call the modern internet today.  [[Prehistory of the Internet]] is nothing short of an experiment, and it's on this topic that I decided to explore some ideas of the actual first internet was/

[[The first internet]] looked like like many things, but I found the most powerful experiment done on the internet was the innovation behind [[Alohanet]] .

![[Alohanet]] 

It's surprising to imagine how important Hawaii was in the creation of the internet, and how imprtant experimental network development is. The Alohanet was a small innovation on the timeline of the internet, but was another example of a network that changed the way information was traded. Using radio signals and turning the internet from something that you physically connected to, to a wireless, abstract thing that transmits in the air is an incredible step in the timeline of the internet, and has taught me how important experimenting with new ideas can lead to the arrival of new applications in science. 

It was in this class that I learned how experimental the Internet still is. Many of the features we see today can be attributed to the sharing of information and finding the most effecient way to do it. From the Silk Road, to Alohanet, the internet is a demonstration of human's search for innovating ways of connecting people, and how innovative we've become through sharing our ideas. This journey is an example of how different ways of sharing information has lead to the innovation of new things, a powerful concept to think about as the internet continues to evolve and grow. Ideas can't grow unless they can be shared, and humans have always found new ways to improve the way they communicate with each other.
