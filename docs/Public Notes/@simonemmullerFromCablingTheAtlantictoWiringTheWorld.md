### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this article by Simone M. Muller,  the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable is reviewed, while offering the suggestion that telegraphy helped globalize the world by connecting politics, markets, and media through greater communication and creating something radically new. The impact of the 1866 transatlantic cable is assessed and through new theoretical approaches such as imagined uses, digital history and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), new avenues of understanding the impact of the cables on everyday life are explored.
