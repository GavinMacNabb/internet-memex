Chat rooms, also known as internet chat, began in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a way for people to communicate online. The first chat room was created by [[CompuServe]] in 1980, allowing users to connect with others in real-time through a text-based interface. Other services soon followed, including[[ America Online (AOL)]], which popularized chat rooms in the mid-1990s. Chat rooms quickly became a popular way to meet and connect with people from around the world, with a variety of topics and interests represented. However, concerns about online safety and the rise of social media platforms led to a decline in the popularity of chat rooms in the early 2000s. Today, chat rooms still exist, but they are less popular than social media and messaging apps.
