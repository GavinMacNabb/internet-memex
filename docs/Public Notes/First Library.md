Concept of the library has existed for many years

The first known library was the Library of Ashurbanipal, which was established in the 7th century BC in the Assyrian city of Nineveh (in present-day northern Iraq). This library contained more than 30,000 clay tablets with information on various subjects, including history, religion, and science.

other ancient civilizations also had their own versions of libraries. For example, the Library of Alexandria in Egypt, which is perhaps the most famous library in history, was founded in the 3rd century BC. This library was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world, containing hundreds of thousands of scrolls and manuscripts.
