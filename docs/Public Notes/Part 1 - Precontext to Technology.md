#### January 11th Archeology
[[First fire]] 
- [Archeology]: Explore what it means to be human through its traces
- [Digital] pertains to digits; descrete numbers and computation as opposed to [Analog] systems, where the values is continuous.
- [Memory storage] of the past
	- Jacquard cards
	- Mount Street Mills
	- AGC Rope
- Different [thing]s and [places] of this history
- Different [archeological theories]
- Different [historical theories]
- What are the questions?
- [Space Economy Theory] - refers to the way invements in infrastructure contract the experience of space between places
- [Complicated vs Complex Theory] - The things we study are often emergent from lower level elements
	- We've got [complicated] individuals enmeshed in systems that collapse time and space
	- [Complex]systems are useful for considering what happens when you've got many different kinds of things interating in non-linear ways.
- [Assemblage Theory] - how does a thing gather unto itself?
	- assemblage composed of human and non-human
	- how actions are distributed across a network
	- you can't divide the world into physical objects/properties and human agency
	- it's the interactions that matters
	- Material Engagement Theory
	- The pot that emerges is driven by an idea in their mind.
		- the pot reacts to the reality of the clay, wheel, water, and past clays made, ambition for future pots. (SAME AS CODING)
- [Perspectivism] - How something is recorded matters
	- many ways to make the decisions
	- these new categories of ideas emerge from engaging with the material
	- Like the pot & clay, if you don't see the relationship with clay, you don't even look to see it
- Dr. Graham: a [network] is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. (Definition of information)
- Networks form a substrate for social life, humans aren't the only things that have a social life
- networks leave physical traces
	- more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in certain network shapes
	- networks provide mechnisms which computation can happen - computation is inherent in the shape of the network
	- the components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage
- Questions to ask:
	- What are the [social]/[political]/[economic] contexts of the [people], [places], [things]?
	- What are the [assemblage]s that make the people, places, things up?
	- How do those assemblages extend in [time] or [space]?

#### January 16th Messages
- physicality of messages/books has impacts in the world
- physicality has changed over time / thus impacts in the world have changed
- when new classifications shift, theres a shift in power too
	- every phase of the 'internet' that we see involves this shift
- With digitization, messages/content had potential to be 'aware' of their relationship to other messages/content - key insight of the memex
- 'hypertext' becomes an attempt at realizing that potential


[Messages and Mediums] 
- The Medium is the Message
- Medium is something that carries something else
[Cave Painting]
[Clay Tablet]
[Classification and the Catalogue]
[Writing Evolution]
- cuneiform in Mesopotamia
- scripts in Crete
- hieroglyphics in Egypt
- Glyph systems in Indus valley
- Rongorongo of Rapanui (Easter Island)
- Varies Glyphs and Physical Systems (Knots / Puiqu / Wampum) in Central and South America
- Character based symbols in China
- notation systems for counting date even earlier
[How did ancient people store and transmit information]
- Clay Tablets
- Papyrus
- Stone
- Wax Tablets
- Engraved in Metals
[Libraries]
- Emerged before alphabetic scripts
- Mari - Settlement founded at start of 3rd millenium
	- Owned more than 3000 letters from 1800-1750 (Starts of 2nd millenium)
	- The ability to own, control, have these things created power, status
- Rooms of scrolls in little pigeon holes; in the roman world [bibliothecae]
- Reflect the world back on itself
- [[Melvil Dewey]] - Dewey Decible system
- [[Memex]] - associative indexing, [[Vannevar Bush]]
- [[Hypertext]] - capture what a computer might know?
- [[Ted Nelson]] - Coined term Hypertext in 1965

- Roger Bacon - 13th century - Europe - Describes various systems of secret writing known to him
- Early Modern Europe (16th to 18th century)
	- intro of a new information technology in Europe (moveable type)
	- faster circulation of ideas
	- new ideas about god, relationship with people, nature of government
	- coinciding with the European age of discovery
- Francis Bacon and the Bi-Lateral Cipher
	- De Augmentis Scientasium of 1623 lays out his system
		- Linkage to typerwriter
	- steganography
- typesetting conevetions
- nomenclators
	- popular in diplomatic circles in 1400 to about 1800
	- Marry Queen of Scotts - nomenclator broken thwarted her attempt to sieze power
- Black chambers, break the nomenclators
	- Blaise de Vigenere, french diplomat mid 16th century, spends time in rome and becomes interested in encipher messages

	- Where are the gaps
	- Where are the women in this story
	- Who/What is left out
	- What otherthings had to have happened to support all this
	- Brecht Poem
#### January 30th Punch Cards
- the point of as we may think article is the assemblage of contemporary technologies giving something of their background and fused imaginateively into the potential future

	- Silk - 3500 - 2700 years ago Archeology suggests
		- Made in India by 3rd Millenium BC
		- Required work to make silk made them luxury items
		- Threads so small that you cant see the weaving if done right
	- Created the silk roads (a linking of a variety of local trade networks into large one from China to Europe)

			- someone elsem ightve come up with the same idea also
			- Cards matter, not the Loom
	- Lovelace figured out how to program the loom
		- people design and build things with no idea how to make the things actually <em>achieve</em> results, and frequently the people who figure out the programming were women.
	- Punch card

#### February 1st Electricity
- Electricity
- Animals create Electricity
- Luigi Galvani
	- 1737 - 1798 Found electricity moved animal limbs
- George Forster
	- law in early 19th c england let murders corpse be used for scientific purposes
	- Giovani Aldini, nephew of Galvani figured the dead could be reanimated
		- Frankenstein??? Mary Shelley
- Thales of Miletus - 600 BC believed that all things had a soul
	- interested how if you rub amber with wool it attracted stuff
- Word of Electricity varies over centuries
	- Gets more used in 16th / 17th century
	- William Gilbert in 16th Century observed how electricity attracted a needle/lodestone
	- always had a connections between electricity and life, even when we didn't know that there was one
- Can we store Electricity?
- Pieter van Musschenbroek invents the Leuden jar - tried capturing static electricity
	- known as first capacitor
- How fast does electictiy go
	- Jean Antoine Nollet arranged 200 monks and found they all got shocked instantly
- Ben Franklin notices that an iron point can conduct electricty away from a charged iron sphere
	- Develops lightening rods to protect buildings and ships
- Alessandro Volta, 1745-1827 becomes aware of Galvani and disagreed
	- argues electric current was a functions of moisture note animal forces.
	- Battery 1800
		- Helps kick start systematic experiemnets and research into electricity
- Electricity and Magnets
- Hans Christian Orsted worked out that current in elecrtic wire creates a circular magnetic field
- Michael Faraday - Works out how to go the other way, use magnets to make electricity
- Joseph Henry - inventor of many elecrical devices, including the relay
- All these things were discovered by multiple people at the same time
- Telegraph
	- Once henry and others invented how circuits can make juice flow with insulations, messages at distance now feasable
	- 1830s saw this and steam powered railways
		- if you wired up enough batteries to a magnet, you could pump enough electricty to do work at a distance
- We can 
	- Store electricty
	- induce electricity to travel
	- induce changes in some device at point B by altering the electricity at point A
	- know how magnetic fields and electricity areconnected
- Things wouldn't of happened without the industrial revolution, without professionalization of what it meants to experiement, to communicate scientific, industrial, engineering knowledge
- For these works to exist, what else had to exist
