In the **6th century BC** the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods: these were the first studies into the production of electricity.

The history of electricity dates back to ancient times when people observed and experimented with static electricity, such as rubbing certain materials together to produce a static charge. However, it wasn't until the 18th and 19th centuries that the modern understanding of electricity began to emerge.

In the 18th century, scientists such as Benjamin Franklin and Luigi Galvani conducted experiments with electricity, leading to the discovery of the principles of electric charge and the invention of the lightning rod and the battery.

In the early 19th century, scientists such as Michael Faraday and André-Marie Ampère conducted further experiments that led to the discovery of the principles of electromagnetic induction and the development of the electric motor and generator. These discoveries paved the way for the widespread use of electricity in industry and transportation.

In the late 19th century, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla made significant contributions to the development of electricity. Edison developed the first practical incandescent light bulb and helped establish the first electric power distribution systems. Tesla made important contributions to the development of alternating current (AC) electricity, which made it possible to transmit electricity over long distances.

The 20th century saw the widespread adoption of electricity for household and industrial use, and the development of new technologies such as computers and electronics that rely on electricity. Today, electricity is a critical part of modern life, powering homes, businesses, and transportation systems around the world.
