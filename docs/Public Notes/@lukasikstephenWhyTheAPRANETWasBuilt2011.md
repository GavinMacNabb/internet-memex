### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article addresses why the ARPANET was built, written by Stephen Lukasik, the director of the department of the defense advanced research project agency. The goal of the project was to exploit new computer technologies during the Cold War and meet the needs of military command and control against nuclear threats, achieve survivable control of US Nuclear Forces, and improve tactical and management decision making. Although not central to the decision to pursue networking, it was recognized that these capabilities were common to non-defense needs, and thus emerged the Internet in 1983. Thus, the contradiction of the Internet emerging as a consequence of the Atomic Bomb.
