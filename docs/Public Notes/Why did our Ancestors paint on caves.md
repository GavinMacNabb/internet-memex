"No one knows why our [prehistoric ancestors](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-human-familys-earliest-ancestors-7372974/) painted cave art. The paintings are mostly located in deep caves and areas that are difficult to access, showing no signs of living spaces."

What could they have meant?
"David Quammen to speculate in his 2003 book [Monster of God](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/scienceandnature.highereducation) that the people who painted the images on the walls of the Chauvet Cave: Recognized more than danger, strength, and power. They also saw grace, grandeur, lordly confidence, quietude, mercilessness, keen attention, and some sort of all-driving primacy in those ferocious beasts; and they took pains to register, to preserve, even somehow to adopt what they saw through the medium of charcoal on rock. Call it shamanism, call it totemism, call it idolatry. Call it, simply, art."
