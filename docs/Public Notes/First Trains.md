The first railroad is generally considered to be the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which opened in England in 1825. The railway was primarily designed for the transportation of coal from the mines to the port of Stockton-on-Tees. The railway used steam locomotives to haul carriages of coal and other goods, and it was also open to passenger traffic.

However, there were earlier examples of primitive railways, such as wooden tramways and wagonways, that were used for transporting goods in mines and quarries. The first recorded use of a wooden railway was in 1515 in Germany, and in England, wooden wagonways were used in coal mines as early as the 17th century.

The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in the 18th century led to the development of steam-powered railways, which revolutionized transportation and had a significant impact on the industrialization of many countries. The first steam locomotive was developed by George Stephenson in 1814, and it was used on the Killingworth Colliery railway in England.
