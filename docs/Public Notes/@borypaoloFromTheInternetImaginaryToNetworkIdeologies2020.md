### Summary & Key Take Aways

Ch1 - Internet Histories, Narratives and the Rise of the Network Ideology

In the book the Internet Myth, the first chapter develops the bigger picture of how the internet formed and the multiplicity of Internet histories and makes visible the complex path of different network projects that have taken place over a variety of cultural, political, economic and social contexts. The lack of depth and complexity of the story of the World Wide Web is shown to be as a result of technological, political, and economic choices that constructed it’s current shape

Ch2 - The Myth of the World Wide Web

In the second chapter of the book “The Internet Myth”, the moment when the term “World Wide Web” was coined has become a symbol of democracy and openness, but has also changed people’s roles in the construction of a better, egalitarian future for societies. It highlights the limited number of key actors in the development of the Internet gives a narrow model of the history of the internet, and that we need to recognize the complex realm of network histories if we want to understand how the internet came to it’s current state.
