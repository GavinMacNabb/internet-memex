### Summary & Key Take Aways

Bonnie Mak's book argues about how information is stored matters just as much as the information itself. In chapter one, the book opens up how the page can be anything from a manuscript, print, digital, or a hybrid, it constitutes a thick network of expressions that continues to change through history. Readers interpret interfaces differently and can build meaning based on how the information is presente, and for its transmission of knowledge, we will continue to explore why the interface of knowledge matters.
