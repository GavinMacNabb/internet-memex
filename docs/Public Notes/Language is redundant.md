>Remember, info theory allows us to separate meaning of a message from its 'information', the measure of its redundancy, hence, the amount of damage it can take and still be understood. Without that insight, nothing else can work. It's what makes digital communications *work*.

Language redundancy refers to the use of multiple words or expressions to convey the same meaning or message. While it may seem counterintuitive, redundancy can actually facilitate communication by increasing clarity and reducing the risk of miscommunication.

In some cases, language redundancy can also lead to the development of new ways of communicating. For example, we can use [[Codes and Combinations]] to alter the symbols we use to represent language. Alternatively, if a particular word or phrase is overused or becomes clich√©, people may start to look for alternative ways to express the same idea. This can lead to the creation of new idioms, metaphors, or other linguistic devices that convey the same meaning in a fresh and creative way.

Additionally, redundancy can provide opportunities for emphasis or nuance. By using multiple words or expressions to describe the same thing, a speaker or writer can convey different shades of meaning or tone. This can be especially important in contexts where precision or clarity are paramount, such as in technical writing or legal documents.

Overall, while redundancy may seem like a flaw or inefficiency in language, it can actually facilitate communication and even inspire new forms of expression.
