- Major problem in civilization: [Communication of information over distance, securely].
- "mch dstrctn cn hppn t mssg bfr t s nrdbl" - [Language features redundancy]. Key element in the creation of digital communication
- [Bandwith] What happens when messages are competing in the same space?
- Fundamental [problems of communication] that have profound consequences.
- [History of the internet] is a history of a particular package of technologies. 
- What frames of internet history can we study
- [Prehistory of the Internet]
- [The first Internet]
- [The modern Internet]

#### January 11th
- [Archeology]: Explore what it means to be human through its traces
- [Digital] pertains to digits; descrete numbers and computation as opposed to [Analog] systems, where the values is continuous.
- [Memory storage] of the past
	- Jacquard cards
	- Mount Street Mills
	- AGC Rope
- Different [thing]s and [places] of this history
- Different [archeological theories]
- Different [historical theories]
- What are the questions?
- [Space Economy Theory] - refers to the way invements in infrastructure contract the experience of space between places
- [Complicated vs Complex Theory] - The things we study are often emergent from lower level elements
	- We've got [complicated] individuals enmeshed in systems that collapse time and space
	- [Complex]systems are useful for considering what happens when you've got many different kinds of things interating in non-linear ways.
- [Assemblage Theory] - how does a thing gather unto itself?
	- assemblage composed of human and non-human
	- how actions are distributed across a network
	- you can't divide the world into physical objects/properties and human agency
	- it's the interactions that matters
	- Material Engagement Theory
	- The pot that emerges is driven by an idea in their mind.
		- the pot reacts to the reality of the clay, wheel, water, and past clays made, ambition for future pots. (SAME AS CODING)
- [Perspectivism] - How something is recorded matters
	- many ways to make the decisions
	- these new categories of ideas emerge from engaging with the material
	- Like the pot & clay, if you don't see the relationship with clay, you don't even look to see it
- Dr. Graham: a [network] is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. (Definition of information)
- Networks form a substrate for social life, humans aren't the only things that have a social life
- networks leave physical traces
	- more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in certain network shapes
	- networks provide mechnisms which computation can happen - computation is inherent in the shape of the network
	- the components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage
- Questions to ask:
	- What are the social/political/economic contexts of the people, places, things?
	- What are the assemblages that make the people, places, things up?
	- How do those assemblages extend in time or space?

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
