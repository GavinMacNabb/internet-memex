### Annotations

---
>In ancient times, the libraries were devoted to the acquisition and preservation of reading materials and used some primitive systems of bibliographical organisation or control to locate available material according to need.

Classifying information is a timeless challenge for civilization

---
>Gradually, librarians realised the advantages of co-operation among libraries and standardisation of practice.

Standardizing practices helps parties co-operate when building new systems

---
>Libraries had begun using computer applications for their catalogues in the latter part of the 20th century.

Computers were an important step in libraries, and vice versa, the library was an important application for the computer.

Without libraries, the ideas needed to assemble the Computer wouldn't have existed

We can probably link Babbage and Vannevar with this

---
>The concept of MARC (Machine Readable Catalogue) heralded a new era in libraries. MARC stimulated the development of library automation and information networks. The Library of Congress launched MARC-I as an experiment when there was no established bibliographic record in machinereadable form. 

Need to look into what MARC was
