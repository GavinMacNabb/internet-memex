Some final thoughts:

Thank you for giving me a new lense to view the internet from.

This course has taught me a lot more than just what the internet is, but has helped me to see all the different naratives that have took place throughout history, and has really changed my relationship I have with technology.

As a Software Engineer, the internet is a focal part of my life, and it honestly baffles me how little I knew about the internet, but I also realized that this topic is somewhat of a new concept. Theres a lot of untold history that it's well known about the internet that is being retold today with the expansive online libraries. I personally had no idea their were ideas as powerful as having a memex, but this class has shown me to treat technology as an experiment. Learning new processes for improving my effeciency is a new idea to explore. I hope to expand my private library and hopefully contribute to the obsidian community.


I've never seen the internet from the lenses of different ages of history, but it has certainly helped me understand the different parts that make up the web, and where I fit into that spectrum. Their are so many challenges that were overcome, but I feel much more comfortable knowing how to uncover the truth, and how to ask the questions that haven't been asked.

The history of the internet is a fascinating tale of innovation and technological advancement that has transformed the way we communicate, work, and access information. In this memex, we will explore the evolution of the internet in three parts: a precontext of the history of technology, a precontext of the internet, and the modern internet we know today.

- [[Part 1 - Precontext to Technology]] (Before 1945) We will begin by examining the technological innovations that laid the foundation for the creation of the internet.

- [[Part 2 - Precontext to the Internet]] (1945 to 1989) We will then delve into the early days of the internet, from the creation of ARPANET to the emergence of the World Wide Web, and explore the key players and technological breakthroughs that enabled the internet to become the ubiquitous and essential tool it is today.

- [[Part 3 - The Internet]] (1989 to Today) Finally, we will look at the modern internet, including the rise of social media, the growth of e-commerce, and the ongoing debates about privacy, security, and regulation in the digital age.
